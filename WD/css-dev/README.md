# HTML & CSS Templates

developed based on the **design guidelines from the UX Team** as of **3/8/2023**

### Please note

- Best viewed on **mobile screen** sizes in **portrait orientation**

- Color codes in *ShowResult* component are just dummies (no guidelines given yet)

### Bugs in Safari
   
- *TakePicture* component → image box is not squared → causing jittery zoom effect at the beginning of the *processing* animation

- *ShowResult* component → *fail* state → the blurred image has a hard edge that is softened only after some time
