## Brainstorm 

Hey @all! 

In this "Brainstorm" section, I just added some info collection about the requirements of the README as well as some suggestions. We need to delete this "Brainstorm" section before final hand in.

Obviously, feel free to change and beautify stuff! This is just a suggestion and just a first version.

### How to fill individual sections:

- Summary: Short project description of not more than 130 words to add to the certificate.
- How to run the demo: Explain what needs to be done for anyone to try the demo. Navigate to the corresponding WD directory, npm install, then npm run dev and so on, but explained in a better way.
- Contributors: Everyone who participated needs to add their name here. If you like, also provide a link to your GitHub profile.

Steps: 

1. Take a photo of your waste. Make sure to present only one object at a time and that your background is neutral.
2. Start inference by pressing "Submit". After a few seconds, you can see the results.
3. If you want to see an interpretation, click "Interpret" and wait a few seconds. This will show you which parts of the image were most important for the model to classify the image.
4. To repeat, hit "Clear" and take a new photo.
