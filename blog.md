<!---
Hey everyone! Just some short notes.
By commenting out text, it will not be rendered in markdown.
To make a comment in markdown just surround your text using this: <!--- --->

You can find a very nice markdown resource following this link: https://www.markdown-cheatsheet.com/

<!---
I suggest that we first make a shared section of the blog post right here in which we describe the idea, the app and the project in some detail. At least more detail than in the README.
Afterwards, I suggest that each track writes one section.

Since we're on the same branch now, not doing this will lead to disaster^^ --->

### Intro
<!--- to be written by Fabian ; remove this comment later on, just helpful while writing--->

### Training
<!--- to be written by Andrea --->

### Interpretation
<!--- both write here --->

#### Regarding the split
Some reservations here: Models built in different frameworks (fastai, tensorflow) do not have the same train/test split, because of different methods used to make these. Setting seed will not help this, because the method itself is different.


#### Misclassifications/confusion matrices, greatest losses, why is that?


#### Interpretability/explainability/XAI etc.


#### Data mismatch
