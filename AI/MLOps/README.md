# Deployment of the Deep Learning Models

This directory contains the work related to the deployment of the different image classifiers. 

## tensorflow_js
Conversion of the exported TensorFlow (Python) models to JavaScript and the tutorial regarding integration with the app. The tutorial can be found at "tensorflow_js/tensorflow_js.ipynb".

## fastai_deploy
Plans for this directory: 
- Make a mini-website demonstrating the image classifier made with fastai
- Convert from fastai to pure PyTorch to TensorFlow to TensorFlow.js, then provide the model to the WebDevs for inserting it into the app.
