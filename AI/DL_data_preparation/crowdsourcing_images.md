Hey guys! WasteWise here.
TLDR: Help us crowdsourcing data for training our models on images of waste 🤗
Detailed:
As you know from the midterm presentations, we train an image classifier to recognize objects of waste and recommend the correct way of disposal for each class. They work quite well on the training/validation data already and can distinguish multiple classes 🎯 However, we have a data problem. Since we downloaded the images from the web, most of them do not represent realistic user data. For example, we mostly have pictures of beautifully shaped banana peels 🍌 or glass bottles in perfect lighting and a clean background instead of a photo of something anyone would like to throw away taken in a real world scenario.
Every model can be only as good as the data it has been trained on. So, as soon as it comes to real users uploading their images, our models might underperform 📉, because their pictures look quite differently. For the app to really take off, we need realistic data!
But there's good news! You can help us out a lot by providing some photos of stuff you would like to throw away! 🙌
If everyone just uploads a couple of photos, we will most likely already be able to considerably improve accuracy. The more pictures we collect, the better. It's important that the photos simulate what a user might upload. To be more specific, please make sure to only include single objects instead of, for example, a pile of waste or too many different things in one photo. Just act as if you were using the app to get help determining which garbage container to use for your waste. Feel free to get creative and upload whatever waste you have at hand, especially things you do not know where to get rid of! 🌈
