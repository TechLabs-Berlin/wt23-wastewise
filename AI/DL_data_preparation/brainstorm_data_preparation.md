# Data Preparation for Deep Learning

## General Notes and Brainstorm
- We will train a neural network for classifying images of pieces of trash.
- It is supposed to output what the respective piece of trash is. Most likely, we will then use some sort of dictionary to connect the class to the proper way of disposal.
- Preferrably, we will use a pre trained model and fine tune it.

## Data

### Image Data
Get from, e.g., Imagenet, Bing search or take own ones.

### Labels
Arrange with rest of the team, especially UX and decide together which labels we will use in the end.
Around 50 labels for different objects (e.g., "banana peel", "plastic bottle", "glass bottle", "aluminum foil", "light bulb", ...) will likely do the job. Selection is not final yet.
